# Vulnerability-Management-Lab
Vulnerability Management Demonstration with Nessus Essentials
<h1>VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT LAB - </h1>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMWare (Virtual Machines/Computer)
- Nessus Essentials
- Vulnerability Remediation

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Accomplishments of the Lab Performed</h2>
- Install and confifgure Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed Vulnerability Scans against Windows 10 hosts
- Implement Vulnerability Management function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify.
- Conduct Vulnerability Assessents with Nessus; Remediate Vulnerabilities.
- Develop automated remediation process to preemptively deal with Vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.

<h2>STEPS FOR THE VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT LAB</h2>

- Download VMWare.
- Download Windows 10 ISO
- Sign up and Download Nessus Essentials
- Open the virtual machine and install Windows 10
- go to wf.msc and turn off all for the virtual machine, this will open ports and show more vulnerabilities on the scan.
- copy the IP address of the virtual machine.
- Create a new scan in Nessus, past the IP in TARGETS, save then scan all ports. This may take some time.
- Check results
- Let's show how more vulnerabilities can occur!
- Go to SHARING SETTINGS and turn ON file and printer sharing; next go to USER ACCOUNT CONTROL and click NEVER NOTIFY ME; Next go to Registry Editor and go through Local Machine to Software to MicrosoftWindows to currentversions to policies to system and create a new system called LOCALACCOUNTTOKENFILTERPOLICY and set value to 1, then close.
- Let's add more vulnerabilities! Download an older version of Firefox.
- Restart the VM and login.
- Go back to Nessus. Add credentials admin and add password used.
- Run new scan and compare the new scan to the old scan.
- Now let's try and remediate the vulnerabilities. We know that the old version of Firefox is a critical vulnerability. So uninstall Firefox.
- Next, we should know that a lot of our other critical vulnerabilities can be fixed with updating to the most up to date version of Windows. So check for Windows updates and update.
-  Once all updates have been installed, go back to Nessus and run a new scan.
-  This scan should show that the vulnerabilities have been remediated.
